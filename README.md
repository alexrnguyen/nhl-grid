# nhl-grid

An NHL trivia game in which users must name a player that played for the teams given on each row and column of a grid. Inspired by similar games including [NHL Grid](https://www.nhlgrid.com/), [Puckdoku](https://www.puckdoku.com/), and [Immaculate Grid](https://www.immaculategrid.com/hockey).

## Upcoming Features

- Save game state when app is closed
- Share a grid with friends
- Rarity scores

## Outstanding Issues

- If a retired player's last team is no longer active (eg. Quebec Nordiques), no image will be returned from getLatestImage()
- Noticeable delay when first loading up application
- No verification that a grid is solvable (due to Vegas and Seattle having relatively few players who have played for other teams)
- Website not optimized for mobile devices
