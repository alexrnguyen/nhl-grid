# nhl-grid

## Outstanding Issues

- If a retired player's last team is no longer active (eg. Quebec Nordiques), no image will be returned from getLatestImage()
- The library I'm using to retrieve NHL players is incomplete (notably players drafted after 2020 are not accounted for)
- Search input needs to be an exact match
- Can use the same player more than once
- Noticeable delay when first loading up application
