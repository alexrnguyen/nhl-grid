# nhl-grid

An NHL trivia game where players are given a grid with each cell
Inspired by similar games including [NHL Grid](https://www.nhlgrid.com/), [Puckdoku](https://www.puckdoku.com/), and [Immaculate Grid](https://www.immaculategrid.com/hockey).

## Upcoming Features

- Search results in search modal
- Save game state when app is closed
- Share a grid with friends
- Rarity scores

## Outstanding Issues

- If a retired player's last team is no longer active (eg. Quebec Nordiques), no image will be returned from getLatestImage()
- Search input needs to be an exact match
- Can use the same player more than once
- Noticeable delay when first loading up application
- No verification that a player exists that satisfies every possible team combination (especially problematic for the recent expansion teams)
